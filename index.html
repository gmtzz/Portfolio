        <p> My name is Giselle Martinez. I am 25 Years old and I reside in Central Connecticut. I graduated college back in 2019 with a bachelor's degree in Communications and a minor in management infomation systems. 
         In my free time, I love to explore new places in my area and make a stop for a cup of freshly brewed coffee. I like to paint on canvas, look for vintage finds at thrift shops or hang out with my family. 
            During the summer, I like to take nature walks or practice longboarding at my local park.
