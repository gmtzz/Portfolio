# Portfolio
This is a portfolio based on what I learned in UConn Coding Bootcamp.
## Description:

The goal of this HTML/CSS Challenge is to refactor the code to include the designated semantic elements such as, main, nav, section and aside to meet accessibility standards. I also changed the CSS style sheet to correspond with the designated HTML elements.These factors affect the accessibility of a webpage because search engines and assitive technologies can read the structure of the webpage optimally. I resolved the problem of using a broader structure of the webpage and prevented technologies and search engines from inaccurately presenting information of the webpage to the user.  Therefore, the assistive technologies will read the HTML and CSS code to represent a format that makes it more logical and comprehensible to the user. 

This webpage is used as a companys homepage to direct you to their services, such as, search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. 
 
This webpage displays the services for the company Horiseon, the user then has the option to click on the services on the nav bar and directs them to the corresponding services sections with their corresponding description and image. 

By refactoring the html and css code, I have provided more structure and included semantic elements that are specific to a webpage.
