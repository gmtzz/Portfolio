# Portfolio
This is a portfolio based on projects worked on in the Uconn coding camp, resume, future applications, and a personal summary.
## Description:

The goal of this assigment was to create code from scratch to include the a portfolio with responsiveness and useful content to future employers. I struggled with adding the correct responsiveness. I added the media screen code in order to create a response of the sections stacked on top of eachother when minimizing the screen. I was not able to successfully execute this response. I also was faced with the challenge of creating the link between the nav bar to direct to the corresponding sections of the body of the webpage. I referred to past assignments and google but was not able to find a solution in a timely manner. The most challenging aspect is corresponding the HTML to CSS, so there were instances I did find an alternative potential solution but I was challenged with corresponding it to the designated CSS code. 

This webpage is used to display my work, objectives, projects, and a personal summary of myself to showcase to potential employers. 
 

By making this webpage from scratch, I used my HTML and CSS knowledge to structure and style my personal portfolio using HTML and CSS.
